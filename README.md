# Enterprise Architecture for AI & Data-Driven Transformation: An Architect's Guide to Business Capability Modeling (BCM)

## Executive Summary
#### In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, enterprise architecture (EA) serves as the critical bridge between business strategy and technological execution, particularly in data-intensive domains such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and advanced analytics. This comprehensive guide outlines how strategic business capability modeling (BCM) enables organizations to systematically align their AI/ML ambitions with executable technology roadmaps, ensuring measurable business outcomes and sustainable competitive advantage.

## 1. The Strategic Imperative: Business Capability Modeling in the AI Era

### 1.1 Defining Business Capability Modeling for Data-Driven Enterprises

##### BCM represents the foundational practice of abstracting an organization's core competencies from its operational implementation. For enterprises pursuing AI and data transformation, this means distinguishing what the business must accomplish (predictive analytics, real-time decisioning, automated operations) from how it currently achieves these outcomes through specific technologies, processes, or organizational structures.

### 1.2 Why Capability Modeling is Non-Negotiable for AI Success

##### Organizations that bypass structured capability modeling for AI/ML initiatives frequently encounter:

- Siloed solutions that cannot scale across business units

- Redundant investments in overlapping technology stacks

- Misalignment between data science experiments and business value streams

- Technical debt accumulation from poorly integrated ML pipelines

- Governance gaps in model lifecycle management and compliance
